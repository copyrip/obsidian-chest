#### notes

first day using obsidian... on my thinkpad T470s, running arch.
I try to use my external keyboard nowadays, to avoid needing to switch between fr and be-latin1.

vim binding is quite ok ðŸ‘Œ and emoji support is perfect ðŸ§Ž!

Should I make a post about this software ? Maybe I'll wait a bit...
